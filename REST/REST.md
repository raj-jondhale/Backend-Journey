# REST

- Representational State Transfer
- REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

## CRUD Operations

- **GET** retrieves resources.
- **POST** submits new data to the server
- **PUT** updates existing data
- **PATCH** update existing data partially
- **DELETE** removes data

## Creating RESTful APIs

    GET     /posts  to get data for all posts

    POST    /posts  to add a new post

    GET     /posts/:id  to get one post (using id)

    PATCH   /posts/:id  to update specific post

    DELETE  /posts/:id  to delete specific post
